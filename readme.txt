Adds a tabbed widget to the Hybrid theme framework that can be used in multiple widget areas.

== Description ==

*Hybrid Tabs* is a widget created for use with the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme framework">Hybrid theme</a>.  It was created because of the demand of users to have an easy-to-use tabbed widget for their sites.  I didn't want to add something like this to the theme, so we settled on a compromise: a plugin/widget.

**This plugin is for WordPress 2.8+ only.**

**Default tabs:**

* Bookmarks/Links (individual link category lists).
* Authors.
* Calendar.
* Categories.
* Daily archives.
* Meta.
* Monthly archives.
* Pages.
* Recent posts (alphabetical).
* Recent posts (chronological).
* Random.
* Tag/term clouds (based on all taxonomies).
* Weekly archives.
* Yearly archives.
